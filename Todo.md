# Todo | Roadmap

I'm planning to improve this repository to add more features to practice some code and add more depth to the demonstration.

## Improvement

[X] - Add loggers to Hub and Worker.

[ ] - Chat group logic improvement - this should look like a real chat.

[ ] - Improve chat UI - maybe using the [NbChatComponent](https://akveo.github.io/nebular/docs/components/chat-ui/overview#nbchatcomponent).

[ ] - Implement ISignalRHub interface.

[ ] - Back-end unit tests.

[ ] - Front-end unit tests.

## New features

[ ] - Add push notifications example - using a toaster in the front-end and a controller to receive notifications in the back-end.

[ ] - Add real-time job process monitoring.

[ ] - Add simultaneous editing of documents example.

[ ] - Add real-time data capturing - maybe track mouse position.
